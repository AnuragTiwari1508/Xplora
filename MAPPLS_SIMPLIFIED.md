# 🗺️ MapPLS Integration - Simplified

## ✅ COMPLETED

I've **removed the complex React map** and made your **HTML MapPLS the primary map solution**:

### What Now Works:
- **Direct HTML Integration**: Your `mappls-map.html` file runs directly in the app
- **Full-Screen Experience**: No React overlays cluttering your map
- **Two-Way Communication**: HTML ↔ React data exchange for XP/stats
- **Clean UI**: Your existing app shell remains unchanged

### How to Use:
1. **Main App**: Go to `/xploraa` → Click "Map" tab
2. **Direct Access**: Visit `/mappls-map` for standalone experience  
3. **Raw HTML**: Access `/mappls-map.html` directly

### Your MapPLS HTML Features (All Preserved):
✅ **Real MapPLS SDK integration**  
✅ **Animated character movement**  
✅ **Click-to-visit places**  
✅ **Geolocation tracking**  
✅ **Game stats overlay**  
✅ **Delhi landmarks**  
✅ **XP & reward system**

### Technical Details:
- **Component**: `MapplsNativeMap` (simplified)
- **Communication**: PostMessage API for React ↔ HTML
- **No Dependencies**: Your HTML runs exactly as you wrote it
- **Performance**: Direct HTML = faster loading

## 🎯 Result
Your MapPLS HTML page is now the **primary map experience** in your React app, with **zero changes** to your existing HTML code and **full preservation** of your UI/UX design.

The complex React map implementation has been **removed** - now it's just your clean HTML MapPLS integration! 🎉
