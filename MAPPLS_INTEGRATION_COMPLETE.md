# 🗺️ MapPLS Integration Guide

## Summary

I've successfully integrated your MapPLS HTML page with your React app in **3 different ways** without changing your existing UI/UX:

## Integration Options

### 1. 📄 Standalone Page Route
- **URL**: `/mappls-map` 
- Direct access to your HTML file
- Full-screen MapPLS experience
- Zero React overhead

### 2. 🖼️ Embedded in React Component  
- **Component**: `MapplsNativeMap`
- Your HTML loads inside an iframe
- Maintains your existing UI overlays
- Preserves game stats and controls

### 3. ⚡ Enhanced Integration
- **Component**: `MapplsNativeMapEnhanced`  
- Two-way communication between HTML & React
- Real-time XP updates
- Achievement notifications

## How to Use

### In Your App Shell
1. Go to `/xploraa` page
2. Click on **Map** tab
3. Use the **Map Mode** selector (top-right):
   - **⚛️ React Map**: Your original complex React map
   - **🗺️ HTML Direct**: Your MapPLS HTML (simple iframe)
   - **⚡ HTML Enhanced**: Your MapPLS HTML with React communication

### Direct Access
- Visit `/mappls-map` for standalone HTML experience

## Features Preserved
